# Opti Tracker

**Opti Tracker** is an AI-powered application designed to **monitor and analyze** user activity in real-time using **facial landmark detection** and **tracking mechanisms**. It provides **feedback alerts** based on user posture, attention level, and fatigue, ensuring better focus and ergonomic posture.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎭 **Real-time Facial Landmark Tracking**: Uses **MediaPipe** to detect and analyze face movement.
- 🔊 **Audio Feedback Alerts**: Notifies users if they are **distracted, sleepy, or have poor posture**.
- 🖥️ **Kivy-based UI**: Provides an interactive interface for tracking and feedback visualization.
- 📂 **Modular Architecture**: Components are structured separately for better code organization.

```

# Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

``` 
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/opti-tracker.git
cd opti-tracker 
```
### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows

```
### 3. Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
# Dependencies

The project relies on the following key libraries:

* Kivy – For GUI development.
* MediaPipe – For real-time facial landmark detection.
* Pygame – For playing audio feedback.
* Additional dependencies listed in requirements.txt.

# 🚀 Usage

To run the Opti Tracker, execute:

```
python main.py

```
This will launch the application and start tracking the user's face, detecting distractions, posture issues, or fatigue, and providing real-time feedback.

# 🛠️ How It Works

Uses MediaPipe to analyze 68 facial landmarks in real time.
Continuously monitors head position, eye movement, and posture.
Triggers audio alerts from the Audio/ folder when:

* User looks away (distracted)
* Slouches (poor posture)
* Shows signs of drowsiness (sleepy)
